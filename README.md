# Cocktails

One of the first iPhone apps I bought was a database of cocktail recipes.
At some point it stopped being updated and while it still ran the writing
was on the wall.  Eventually it stopped working entirely when the iOS
made the jump to 64-bit and refused to run older apps.

Digging around in some backups I found I had a copy of the app package and
exploring it I found that there was a sqlite db in there that contained
all the cocktail recipes.

This is the code for a static web version of that app.  The actual data
from the db is not included as I have no idea if it'd be legal for me to
put it anywhere.
